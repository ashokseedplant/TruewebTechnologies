# Project Context

This project is a modern remake (clone) of the old website https://www.truewebtechnologies.com/ using Next.js and ShadCN UI. Please ensure all Copilot and AI requests are made with this context in mind.

# How to Use Copilot for Your Project

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Clearly describe what you want. For example:
   - “Add a new menu item under ‘Our Expertise’ with an icon.”
   - “Align all icons and text in the mega menu to the left.”
   - “Make the logo white in dark mode.”

2. **Mention UI Library**: Always state you are using ShadCN UI components, not plain HTML.

3. **Request Full Solutions**: Ask for complete code or patches, not just suggestions.

4. **Ask for Visual Consistency**: If something looks off, say exactly what (e.g., “Icons are not aligned,” “Spacing is inconsistent”).

5. **Request Icon Suggestions**: If you want icons, ask Copilot to pick the most relevant Lucide icon.

6. **For Styling Issues**: Say “Fix the CSS so all items look consistent in both light and dark mode.”

7. **For New Features**: Describe the feature and where it should appear (e.g., “Add a dark mode toggle in the header”).

8. **For Bugs**: Describe the bug and what you expect to happen.

**Example Prompt:**  
“Update the ‘Web Designing’ submenu in the mega menu so all icons and text are perfectly left-aligned, using only ShadCN UI components. Add missing icons where needed.”
